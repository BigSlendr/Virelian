				<h2>Oversight Model</h2>
				<p>Virelian operates under a foundational charter that establishes independence, public accountability, and ethical consistency as governing principles. Decision-making authority is distributed across standards review, credential administration, and institutional communications to prevent concentration of influence and ensure procedural integrity.</p>

				<hr class="divider">

				<h2>Standards Committee</h2>
				<p>The Standards Committee is responsible for reviewing credential applications, adjudicating disputes, and recommending updates to published guidelines. Committee members are selected for professional experience, ethical judgment, and commitment to transparency. All standards decisions are documented and subject to institutional review.</p>

				<hr class="divider">

				<h2>Disputes & Review</h2>
				<p>Contributors whose credentials are suspended or revoked have the right to request formal review. Disputes are evaluated by an independent panel with no prior involvement in the case. Review decisions are final and documented in institutional records. Virelian maintains a commitment to fair process and consistent application of published standards.</p>
