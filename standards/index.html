				<details>
					<summary>Identity & Attribution</summary>
					<p>All contributors must maintain consistent and accurate attribution across published work. Anonymous or pseudonymous contributions require prior institutional review and documented justification. Impersonation, false credentials, or misrepresentation of affiliation constitute grounds for immediate credential suspension.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Conflicts of Interest</summary>
					<p>Financial, personal, or organizational conflicts that may influence coverage must be disclosed in advance to editors or supervising authorities. Undisclosed conflicts discovered after publication require correction and may result in credential review. Contributors with direct financial interest in covered entities should recuse themselves from related assignments.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Corrections & Retractions</summary>
					<p>Errors of fact must be corrected promptly and transparently. Corrections should be clearly labeled and placed in proximity to the original claim. Systemic inaccuracy or failure to issue timely corrections may trigger credential review. Retractions of substantive reporting require institutional documentation and public notice.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Source Handling & Confidentiality</summary>
					<p>Confidential sources must be protected except in cases of legal compulsion or documented deception. Promises of anonymity must be honored unless the source has materially misled the journalist about facts central to the story. Off-the-record agreements must be explicit and mutually understood before information is shared.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>AI Assistance & Disclosure</summary>
					<p>Use of AI tools for drafting, research, or content generation must be disclosed in bylines, editor's notes, or methodology sections. Fully AI-generated content presented as original human work constitutes a standards violation. Contributors remain responsible for factual accuracy and ethical compliance of all published material, regardless of tools used.</p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>Professional Conduct</summary>
					<p>Contributors are expected to maintain professional integrity in public interactions, source relationships, and institutional communications. Harassment, threats, or abuse directed at sources, colleagues, or subjects may result in credential suspension. Conduct that materially undermines public trust in the credentialing process will be subject to review and potential revocation.</p>
